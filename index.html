u - untracked
git status
git add file name
m - modified
inorder to add all the modified files in a repository, we use commad
git add . 

now commit 
git commit -m "message"

now push
note:
earlier we had a repository(the one we copied the link for the repo)
so we were able to easily push using git push command.

but here the repo is not present in github, we need to push or update the entire folder or repo into git now


hence now create a new repo in github
now connect the newly created repo to vscode

usually we will be given a command in github to connect, the git remote command

ie. git remote add origin link 

now vs code is connected to the origin.

git branch
=> master

becz both main and master names were used as branch names, but are not same, u cannot push 
main and master with anyone of the names. 

either push with the respective names or change the master branch name to main

to change branch name
git branch -M main

git branch
=> main 

now u can perform the command,
git push origin main
